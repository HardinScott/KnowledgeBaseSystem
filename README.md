# Cybersecurity Based Knowledge Management System

## About / Synopsis

C-KMS aims to store and retrieve corporate information security knowledge, improve collaboration, locate knowledge sources, mine repositories for hidden knowledge, capture and use knowledge in the workplace. 

The target users of C-KMS would be company employees who use information systems in their day-to-day work. Two fundamental technologies will significantly contribute to the development, implementation, and maintenance of C-KMS: portals and databases. To that end, general users (company employees) should be comfortable to obtain security-relevant knowledge they need at work (i.e., ease of use and usability of C-KMS), while they can engage in the knowledge-creating process via the portal, posting questions, insights, and even solutions related to corporate information security."

Our team will deploy a solution using web technologies in order to be accessible from any device. Our team will strive to develop a system with ease of use along with the necessary structure required to stored data that can answer questions user provide the system along with the ability for data expand ability through content uploaded by users and curated by approved users in the community.
